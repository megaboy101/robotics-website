					<h3>Mechanical</h3>
					<p>
						Our mechanical team focuses on hardware and construction; it’s
						structure, it’s moving parts, and it’s maintenance. This team
						studies the applications of pneumatics, motors, and gearboxes,
						along with engineering design and physics.

				<p>
					FIRST focuses on sparking the minds of students in science and technology
					while preparing them with life skills. FIRST has two core values, GraciouS
					Professionalism (GP) and Coopertition. GP encourages high quality work,
					emphasizes the value of others, and respects individuals throughout the
					competition. Coopertition is displaying unqualified kindness and respect
					in the face of fierce competition.

							Frank started getting involved when his oldest daughter was a freshman
							(2012) and has been volunteering since. Although he doesn't have a degree
							in engineering he does have experience with both electrical and mechanical
							systems along with woodworking; resulting in our imagery award at our
							Orlando Regional competition, creating the 'ye old bot cart' out of wood.
							He helps the team brainstorm and encourage them to think differently.
							He inspires the kids to do their best and to be proud of their work.
